  		<h1>Vadio Visualization of Data</h1>
  		<p>This is a result of a query on all countries of the EU, the count of sessions on each station (daily), on January 28, 2016. Enhancements to this visualization in particular would be some way to traverse through dates, creating new inquiries through the UI to pass to the server. Obviously this could be expanded to choose different locations and limit the stations represented. Hover the country names or circles to see the numbers behind the circles.</p>
